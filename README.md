<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While taking a look at many Data Science projects sometimes it comes to my mind, there is no full understanding of used features.
In this repo I would like to present some cases to show some issues caused by "easy" use of some features.

## Project

So far only 1 subproject based on this was done. Below you find description of each one.

### Quartiles in frequency domain

Quartiles divide an ordered dataset into four equal parts, and refer to the values of the point between the quarters. 
Measure it allow to somehow describe the distribution of energy in frequency domain. However, many people do not know what exactly is returned from FFT.
It can cause a serious change in quartiles output. Those can be in some cases estimated before even couting qurtiles(Q2) or get another qurtile by just knowing another(Q1 and Q3)
